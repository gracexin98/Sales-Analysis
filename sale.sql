---- ANALYSIS
---- Let's start by grouping sales by productline
-- select PRODUCTLINE, sum(sales) AS Revenue
-- from [dbo].[sales_data_sample]
-- group by PRODUCTLINE
-- order by 2 desc;

-- select YEAR_ID, sum(sales) AS Revenue
-- from [dbo].[sales_data_sample]
-- group by YEAR_ID
-- order by 2 desc;

-- select  DEALSIZE,  sum(sales) AS Revenue
-- from [dbo].[sales_data_sample]
-- group by  DEALSIZE
-- order by 2 desc; 


---- What was the best month for sales in a specific year? How much was earned that month? 
-- select  MONTH_ID, sum(sales) AS Revenue, count(ORDERNUMBER) AS Frequency
-- from [dbo].[sales_data_sample]
-- where YEAR_ID = 2004 --change year to see the rest
-- group by  MONTH_ID
-- order by 2 desc;


---- November seems to be the month, what product do they sell in November, Classic Cars
-- select  MONTH_ID, PRODUCTLINE, sum(sales) AS Revenue, count(ORDERNUMBER)
-- from [dbo].[sales_data_sample]
-- where YEAR_ID = 2004 AND MONTH_ID = 11 --change year to see the rest
-- group by  MONTH_ID, PRODUCTLINE
-- order by 3 desc;
