# SALES ANALYSIS
<b> Applied SQL, Tableau, statistical modeling (RFM model) in the project. </b>

## Data
The dataset tracks 2,500+ customer orders over 3 years, 19 countries, recording their purchase date, expenditure, and quantity bought.

## Step One : Data wrangling
In this step, I clean the raw data and checking unique values. </br>
Variables Status, ProductLine, Country, DealSize and Territory are nice to plot. 

## Step Two : Analysis
I started by grouping sales by productline. </br>
What was the best month for sales in a specific year? How much was earned that month? </br>
November seems to be the month, what product do they sell in November? </br>
Who is our best customer? (this could be best answered with RFM)

## Final Data
I finalize the data using Tableau.

## Dashboard Key Findings
From the plots I can discover : </br>
1. Distribution of Revenue by Country </br>
2. Quantity Distribution </br>
3. Sales Distribution </br>
4. Customer Distribution by Country </br>
5. Revenue of ProductLine </br>
6. DealSize Distribution </br>
7. Revunue by Status </br>
8. Sales by ProductLine and Order Year </br>
9. Monthly Sales by country </br>
